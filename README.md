# dg-league-api

This project was built for my capstone project at devCodeCamp. It provides an API for a disc golf league app where you can search and register for leagues and submit results to league events. To find out more, check out the app [here](https://github.com/LeeStratman/dg-league-app).

## Technology

- Node.js
- Express
- Axios
- JSONWebToken
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Status

The project is still a work in progress. Future iterations will include searching for leagues based on your location and adding different scoring rules such as player handicaps to make the leagues more beginner friendly.
